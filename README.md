# CODETECH-IT--SPEECH-RECOGNITION-SYSTEM-TASK-4

NAME : SRIMATHI

COMPANY : CODTECH IT SOLUTIONS

INTERN ID : CT08QQF

DOMAIN : EMBEDDED SYSTEMS

DURATION :  FEBRUARY 5th, 2025 to MARCH 5th, 2025 (4 WEEKS)

MENTOR : NEELA SANTHOSH

### **Objective**
To develop a speech recognition simulation using push buttons to control a light and fan via a microcontroller. The system simulates a real speech-controlled home automation system, where each button represents a voice command.

### **Key Components**
Arduino Microcontroller – Controls the logic for toggling the light and fan.
Push Buttons – Simulates voice commands to switch the light and fan ON/OFF.
Relays (or LEDs in Simulation) – Controls electrical appliances based on button presses.
Serial Monitor (Virtual Terminal in Wokwi) – Displays status updates when devices are switched ON/OFF.
Debouncing Mechanism – Prevents false triggering when buttons are pressed.


### **Technology Used**
Embedded C (Arduino IDE) – Used for programming the microcontroller.
Digital Input Handling – Reads the button states for toggling devices.
Serial Communication (UART) – Prints real-time updates to the Serial Monitor.
Relay Control (Simulated via Digital Output) – Controls the state of connected appliances.
Button State Change Detection – Ensures that state changes occur only once per press.

### **SIMULATOR OUTPUT**
